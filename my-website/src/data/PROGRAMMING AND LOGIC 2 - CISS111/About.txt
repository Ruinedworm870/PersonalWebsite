Programming and Logic 2 was the second programming class I took in college at the same time as Python Programming. Most of these programs are still quite simple, but they show the use of more advanced topics with tougher problems. Programs 7, 9, and 12 use Javafx graphics. Some of the more notable programs may be the ones with higher numbers (I think they mark the week they were assigned). Program 13 is interesting because it uses a linked stack to determine proper nesting of (), [], and {}. Program 12 is also interesting as it uses a linked list to keep track of high scores based on what the user enters in the GUI. I think this was the first program I lost points due to it not producing the correct results although in my testing before I submitted it I didn't get any errors, but I just tested it again and there can be a slight error when removing a name. Overall these are some of the best and most organized/documented programs I wrote for school.
