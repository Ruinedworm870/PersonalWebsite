Python Programming was the second programming class I took in college at the same time as Programming and Logic 2. There isn't many programs in this class as most of them were copying what the professor had for an assignment, so I didn't include those because I didn't write them. The 5 that are here were the projects that we had to make from scratch except for HelperModule which the professor had us use. Having made only 5 programs from scratch in Python is also the reason why I wrote the original version of this website with Python, so I could get more experience with it. The most notable of the programs here would be program 5 which creates a simple GUI and acts as a simple calculator.
