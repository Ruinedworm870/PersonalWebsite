Advanced Java Programming is the last programming class I took in college. Most of these programs had starter code supplied by the professor (most of the ones that start with ex which stands for exercise). Even though they were supplied with starter code it was usually just an outline of the methods that he wanted us to use and the declaration of some variables which saved a little bit of time when it came to writing these. Some scripts were also given completely to us in these exercises (the ones without my name at the top don't contain any code I wrote). The assignments were the ones that I built from scratch (the ones with actual names). There was only 4 of those, but the class was more focused on advanced topics and less on writing a program in its entirety. CatSnake is the only assignment that used graphics, and there are a few exercises that use them as well. All of these programs are also organized into units rather than when they were assigned, so not all of the ones in a unit go together, they just cover the same topic.
