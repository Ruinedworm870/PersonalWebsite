# PersonalWebsite
My personal website containing information about me and my portfolio.

This is being actively developed by me and will replace my current website: https://williamsmolinskijr.com

I'm using Next.js to develop the site. The site works in it's current version (not live quite yet), I have some additions in mind that I'm in the progress of implementing. 

I don't have the video files commited to this repo.
