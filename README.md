# PersonalWebsite
My personal website containing information about me and my portfolio.

This is being actively developed by me and will replace my current website: https://williamsmolinskijr.com

I'm using Next.js to develop the site. I have a few additions in mind, but for now I'm focusing on just copying and improving what I already have.
