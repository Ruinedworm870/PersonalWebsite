# PersonalWebsite
My personal website containing information about me and my portfolio.

I'm using Next.js to develop the site. I have some additions in mind that I'm in the progress of implementing. 

The updated site running with Next.js is live here: https://williamsmolinskijr.com

The site is running files from V_1.0.1

I don't have the video files commited to this repo.
